Overview:
The New Zealand Electricity Authority produces monthly reports on electricity meter register configurations for NZ electricity networks.  The count of specific combinations of meter register details is provided.

This project is undertaken by 221b Limited.  

The R script extracts, reshapes and aggregates these data to produce charts to indicate the count of specific meter register content codes, period of availabilty and energy flow direction.

This is useful for developing electricity meter register maps for electricity tariffs, and identifying irregular (illogical) meter register details.
Examples include load flow with generation code, uncontrolled without 24 hour availability, controlled load with 24 hour availabilty etc.

Source data appears to exclude inactive (de-energised) ICPs.
